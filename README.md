<ul>

### <li>JavaScript Password Generator</li>

<p>
Generates secure passwords with granular controls for the user. Developed using React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and 
Material UI.
</p>

<p>
Features a slider to determine the desired length of the users password as well as
multiple selections for the user to select the special characters they would like to have integrated into the password.
This is all handled locally in the users browser and nothing is stored in any way.
</p>


### <li>Smart Thermostat API Integration</li>

<p>
Uses a Raspberry Pi to control a DC motor that sprays air freshener into my home HVAC system. It uses
Google's Nest API to determine if the HVAC system is currently operating and uses that information to determine
when to actuate the motor to disperse air freshener throughout my entire house.
