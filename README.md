<ul>

### <li>JavaScript Password Generator</li>

<p>Generates secure passwords with granular controls for the user. Developed using React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and 
Material UI.</p>

<p>Features a slider to determine the desired length of the users password as well as
multiple selections for the user to select the special characters they would like to have integrated into the password.
This is all handled locally in the users browser and nothing is stored in any way.</p>


### <li>Python Machine Learning Program</li>

<p>Uses a random forest classifier to determine a user's risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on lab values 
and lifestyle metrics. Developed using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy.</p>

<p>Trained and tested on a dataset containing ~70,000 records with all PII removed to remain HIPAA compliant. A 30/70 
was used when training the model and has subsequently provided predictions with an approximately 75% accuracy rating.</p>
